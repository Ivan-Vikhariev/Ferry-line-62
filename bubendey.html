            <h1>Bubendey-Ufer</h1>


            <p>The Bubendey-Ufer rear light, together with the Bubendey-Ufer front light, forms the Bubendey-Ufer
                leading light line for ships travelling up the Elbe in the Waltershof district of Hamburg.

                The tower is red and white striped and has a red lantern house. It stands around 1,010 metres away from
                the front light directly at the western entrance to the Parkhafen, for which it has no significance,
                however, and a new rear light was planned for 2013/14, as the previous rear and front lights had to be
                demolished due to the expansion of a terminal. The new rear light will then have a height of 99.2 metres
                and will therefore be around 16 metres taller than Europe's tallest lighthouse to date, the Phare de
                l'ÃŽle Vierge in Brittany. To avoid the risk of confusion with container gantry cranes, the tower will be
                striped in black and white. As of October 2023, work has not yet begun as the western expansion of the
                Eurogate Container Terminal continues to be delayed
