            <h1>Finkenwerder</h1>

            <p>Finkenwerder is located on the southern bank of the Lower Elbe and is bordered to the south by the Alte
                Süderelbe and to the east by the Köhlfleet. The communities to the south-west, beyond the Mühlenberger
                Loch, belong to the Altes Land.
                A considerable part of the peninsula is taken up by agricultural land and the Airbus factory site with
                the Hamburg-Finkenwerder airfield, which is also the headquarters of Airbus Operations GmbH.
                The district of Waltershof, which also belongs to the Hamburg-Mitte district, borders Finkenwerder to
                the east and is geographically separated from Finkenwerder by the Köhlfleet and Dradenauhafen harbour.
                Four neighbourhoods in the district of Harburg border Finkenwerder to the south: Altenwerder behind the
                Aue, Francop and Neuenfelde on the other side of the Alte Süderelbe and Cranz at the western end of the
                Mühlenberger Loch. There, Finkenwerder has a western border within the Elbe with the Lower Saxony
                municipality of Jork in the district of Stade. The districts of Blankenese, Nienstedten and Othmarschen
                on the other side of the Elbe in the district of Altona border Finkenwerder to the north.</p>
