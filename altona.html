            <h1>Altona (Fischmarkt)</h1>
            <p> As early as the 19th century there were attempts to merge the two already existing fish-markets of
                Hamburg and Altona into one common fishmarket. This merging was to take place mainly due to decades of
                ongoing rivalry between those two fishmarkets. The two fishmarkets were in fact only separated by
                official administrative borders: Altona's salesroom for fish, which has been operating since 1896, was
                only a few hundred metres away from Hamburg's salesroom, which remained on this site until 1971. After
                many negotiations, the two cities came to an arrangement about the modalities of a merger. In July 1934,
                the "Fischmarkt Hamburg Altona G.m.b.H." took up business as a subsidiary manufacturing company

                On the political side of things, the process was finally completed as the Greater Hamburg Act came into
                force on 1 April 1937 after several years of discussion. Former Prussian Altona was united with Wandsbek
                and Harburg-Wilhelmsburg with Hamburg, while Hamburg in return had to cede the city of Geesthacht, some
                smaller municipalities and its fishing port of Cuxhaven to Prussia. Through this process, the company
                was renamed to Fish Market Hamburg-Altona GmbH (FMH) in March 1938.

                The shared Fischmarkt Hamburg-Altona alongside the big Weser markets became the most important fishing
                harbor in Germany. It grew to be the leading market for gourmet fish, the biggest trans-shipment center
                for herring and temporarily the dominating location of the German fish industry. Extensive changes in
                the international fish and fishing industry in the following years and decades were the reason that the
                main business of the FMH gradually shifted. The FMH succeeded in expanding the Fischmarkt Altona into
                the only specialized location for premium seafood products in Germany. It currently covers about a third
                of the consumption of fresh fish in the metropolitan area of Hamburg. Simultaneously, the development
                and marketing of commercial space for the fish industry businesses took on greater significance. In the
                1980s, the FMH transitioned into a modern service industry
