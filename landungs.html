            <h1>Landungsbrücken</h1>
            <p>
                The Landungsbrücken are located in the Hamburg district of St. Pauli between Niederhafen and St. Pauli
                Fischmarkt on the River Elbe and are named after the district. - The street Bei den St.
                Pauli-Landungsbrücken runs along the shore side of the Landungsbrücken. At the western end of the
                multi-storey, landside building complex is the northern entrance to the Old Elbe Tunnel in a separate
                domed
                building. The eastern end of the building complex is formed by the tide gauge tower. Halfway up the
                tower on
                the Elbe side, a water level indicator is embedded in the top of the wall to provide information on the
                current tide level. In its second function, the water level tower is also a clock and bell tower. The
                clock
                face is visible from afar. The bell rings on the hour and half hour to the rhythm of the sea chimes.
                Opposite the eastern end of the jetties, almost in line with them, is the overseas bridge on a separate
                pontoon facility, which was formerly the landing stage for passenger ships travelling to and from ports
                abroad. The cargo motor ship Cap San Diego is also permanently moored here as a museum ship. Hamburg
                Landungsbrücken station consists of an underground station, an S-Bahn station and bus stops, making it a
                transport hub in Hamburg. The Landungsbrücken are also a tourist attraction, as they offer an
                interesting
                view of the Norderelbe, the shipyards opposite and the harbour basin. </p>
