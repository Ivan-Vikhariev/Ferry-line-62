            <h1>Dockland (Fischereihafen)</h1>


            <p>Dockland is an office building on the River Elbe near the former England ferry terminal and current
                cruise terminal in Hamburg's Altona-Altstadt district (Van-der-Smissen-Stra√üe 9). The six-storey
                building has a striking cross-section in the shape of a parallelogram and juts out over the water like
                the bow of a ship.

                The site between the fishing harbour and the Elbe was filled in at the end of 2002. The building was
                completed in 2005 and inaugurated on 31 January 2006.

                Dockland was designed by Hamburg architects BRT Architekten Bothe Richter Teherani. A special feature of
                the building is the diagonal passenger lifts.

                The almost 500 square metre roof terrace offers a good view over the port of Hamburg and the northern
                bank of the Elbe; it is accessible to the public via one of the two open staircases; however,
                representatives of the press require a filming permit.

                The building is 25 metres high, with 136 steps leading up to the platform.

                The side surface is a parallelogram 86 metres long and 25 metres high. The building has a total length
                of 143 metres. The building is 21 metres wide.

                The building is currently used by the Nordakademie Graduate School, among others.
