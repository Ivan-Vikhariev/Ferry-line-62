            <h1>Neumühlen/Övelgönne</h1>

            <p>On the Elbe beach, you can not only enjoy sunbathing and then relax, but also take part in various
                leisure activities. Locals, but also many holidaymakers, use the kilometre-long beach on the Elbe in
                summer and winter to go for a walk and watch the huge container ships in the harbour. Sports enthusiasts
                can be seen jogging or walking here. Barbecues are also permitted at certain spots on the Elbe beach.
                However, you must ensure that no rubbish is left behind after the barbecue. You can also enjoy a picnic
                with friends on the Elbe beach in Hamburg. There are several hotels near the Elbe beach. It is also
                possible to camp near the beach. A special attraction is located directly on the Elbe beach. This is
                where the boulder Der Alte Schwede is located. This stone was found in 1999 during dredging work on
                the Elbe. The large boulder weighs 217 tonnes.
                This is where suits with an after-work beer meet students and families with suitcase barbecues. The view
                of the harbour offers a unique panorama and the passing cruise ships and container ships - a highlight,
                not only for young visitors. Thanks to the improved water quality in recent years, swimming in the Elbe
                is once again possible. However, the currents and tides should be taken into account.</p>
